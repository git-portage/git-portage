[UNASSIGNED]
	The baselayout /etc/fstab shm line should be changed to:
	swapfs      /dev/shm        swapfs      defaults                0 0                   
	I'm putting this in here so that Achim knows about this change :)
	This also means that swapfs support is required in the kernel, and should be mentioned
	in the install guide.

[UNASSIGNED] blender-2.04 is linked to libMesaGLU and friends.  But, the nvidia 
	(and xfree86, I think) packages don't install libMesa compatibility symlinks.
	We need to either fix this or create a mesa-compat package.

[achim] updating package-dependencies based on sys-build as a minimum
	set of packages

[æchim] module-config management

[achim] better devfs support and updating packages that do not
	support devfs

[æchim] fixing problems with alsa-drivers 

[drobbins] add csh support to env-update

[drobbins] enhanced useradd script for 1.0_rc4
 (is there still a problem with the minimal useradd in shadow-20001016?)

[drobbins] recursive pkgmerge for 1.0_rc4

[drobbins] A configfile management system is needed (1.0_rc5+)

[UNASSIGNED] add supervise support to various packages (ongoing...)
	
[UNASSIGNED] Upgrade fetch feature of ebuild to eliminate partial download problem.
	(download is aborted, partial file sits in /usr/portage/distfiles and possibly get your
	md5sums corrupted)

[UNASSIGNED] Perl-5.6.0-r3's tcp and udp tests fail when my iptables-based stateful firewall is up.
Is there a safe way to skip these tests?
